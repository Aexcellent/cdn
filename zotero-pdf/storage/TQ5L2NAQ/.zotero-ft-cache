Abstract
Purpose – Decision making in logistics is an increasingly complex task for organizations as these involve decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels coupled with the triple-bottom line of sustainability. Decision support systems (DSS) played a vital role in arguably solving the challenges associated with decision making in sustainable logistics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of the research in the domain of DSS for logistics while considering sustainability aspects. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic review approach using a set of relevant keywords with several exclusion criteria was adopted to identify literature related to DSS for sustainable logistics. A total of 40 papers were found from 1994 to 2015, which were then analyzed along the dimensions of publishing trend, geographic distribution and collaboration, the most influential journals, affiliations and authors as well as the key themes of identified literature. The analysis was conducted by means of bibliometric and text mapping tools, namely BibExcel, gpsvisualizer and VOSviewer. Findings – The bibliometric analysis showed that DSS for sustainable logistics is an emerging field; however, it is still evolving but at a slower pace. Furthermore, most of the contributing affiliations belong to the USA and the UK. The text mining and keyword analysis revealed key themes of identified papers. The inherent key themes were decision models and frameworks to address sustainable logistics issues covering transport, distribution and third-party logistics. The most prominent sustainable logistics issue was carbon footprinting. Social impact has been given less attention in comparison to economic and environmental aspects. The literature has adequate room for proposing more effective solutions by considering various types of multi-criteria decision analysis methods and DSS configurations while simultaneously considering economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable logistics. Moreover, the field has potential to include logistics from wide application areas including freight transport through road, rail, sea, air as well as inter-modal transport, port operations, material handling and warehousing. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review of DSS for sustainable logistics using bibliometric and text analysis. The key themes and research gaps identified in this paper will provide a reference point that will encourage and guide interested researchers for future study, thus aiding both theoretical and practical advancements in this discipline.

Introduction Logistics is vital to the success of supply chains and inevitably linked with the overall organizational performance. The activities may involve freight transport, materials handling, storage and inventory management. Logistics has the potential of bringing

tremendous impact on local as well as global trade by aiming to supply the right items at the right place and right time. In the past two decades, there has been a growing concern for environmental and social impacts of logistics besides economic aspects. In this regard, the term “green logistics” and “sustainable logistics” has been used by organizations and academic researchers.
According to Chang and Qin (2008), “The green logistics refers to plan, control, management and implementation of the logistics system through the advanced logistics technology and environmental management, aiming to reduce the pollutant emission.” Zhao et al. (2009) further explained that “the meaning of green logistics is to improve resource utilization, reduce resource consumption and waste, and minimize environmental pollution when implementing logistics activities, through rational planning, optimize resource allocation and use environmental technology.” Mckinnon et al. (2012) defined “green logistics” as the study of the environmental effects of all the activities involved in logistics in both forward and reverse directions. Sbihi and Eglese (2010) suggested that “green logistics is concerned with producing and distributing goods in a sustainable way, taking account of environmental and social factors.”
The most widely accepted definition of sustainable development was given by the World Commission on Environment and Development which is concerned with the fulfillment of the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (WCED, 1987). Elkington (1997) suggested the consideration of three closely interrelated economic, ecological (environmental) and social aspects of sustainability in a “triple-bottom line.” The scope of sustainability in supply chain and logistics has also been borrowed from these concepts. However, there is still a lack of consensus among researchers over a unified definition of green and sustainable logistics, and both of these terms have been used interchangeably in the literature with a different implied scope. Moreover, the formal definition of “sustainable logistics” is relatively scarce in literature compared to “green logistics.” It is evident that environmental issues are extensively addressed in the literature in comparison to that of social issues, which is partially covered under green logistics. The lack of research addressing social issues in sustainable logistics gives the field a direction to develop further considering sustainability in logistics as a whole giving equal importance to economic, environmental and social aspects. In the context of this study, we are limiting our scope to those papers that have addressed economic as well as at least either the environmental or social dimension of sustainability.
Given the situation, it is now increasingly difficult for organizations to make logistical decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels in line with the triple-bottom line of sustainability. Much of the research work and initiatives were carried out to make logistics more sustainable. In this regard, and in other subject areas, decision support systems (DSS) in logistics may help companies to make fast and more effective decisions.
There exist many definitions of DSS in the literature. In fact, DSS is highly context sensitive as it means different things to different people (Turban and Turban, 2007). Gorry and Morton (1971) defined DSS as “the interactive computer-based systems, which help decision makers utilize data and models to solve unstructured problems.” As the chosen subject area is comparatively new, the scope of the study is further expanded from the given DSS definition and also includes DSS frameworks and models as well as review articles that may contribute toward developing a DSS. This also involves papers addressing logistics issues alongside their focus on supply chain.
This paper is an attempt to conduct a systematic literature review of DSS for sustainable logistics, which reveals the existing state of research in this area and provides researchers and organizations with a direction to develop this field further. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the methodology is discussed in the next section followed by initial data analysis and statistics, bibliometric analysis, discussion section and finally the conclusion.

Methodology According to Fink (1998), “A literature review is a systematic, explicit, and reproducible design for identifying, evaluating, and interpreting the existing body of recorded documents.” Systematic literature reviews are different from conventional narrative reviews in that they are more transparent and reduce bias in literature search and summarize them objectively (Petticrew and Roberts, 2006). A three-step process for the systematic literature review is described below, which was adapted from Fahimnia et al. (2015):
(1) Choosing appropriate search terms: a total of 45 keywords were identified by the authors through a brainstorming process. A four-level keyword assembly structure is used to gather all relevant literature where the first three levels with 37 keywords set inclusion criteria; however, the fourth level with eight keywords sets exclusion criteria. The assembly structure is given in Table I. The first level contains keywords belonging to DSS; however, levels 2 and 3 contain all the appropriate keywords related to logistics and sustainability, respectively. The fourth-level keywords are intended to filter out areas related to city logistics, municipal waste collection, pipeline and electricity distribution which are irrelevant and excluded from this study.
(2) Initial search results and delimitation: the authors have chosen Scopus, which is the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed research literature delivering a comprehensive overview of the world’s research output in the field of science, technology, medicine, social sciences, and arts and humanities (Elsevier, 2016a). It covers over 20,000 peer-reviewed journals (Elsevier, 2016b) including those published by Elsevier, Emerald, Inderscience, Informs, Springer and Taylor and Francis. One limitation of Scopus is the limited access to the publications before 1996. However, given the emerging nature of our research area, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on our findings. Initially, the first three levels of keywords were employed in the title, abstract and keywords search of the Scopus database. The search result returned a total of 367 articles until the end of 2015. The initial search result was further reduced gradually by using fourth-level keywords followed by excluding health sciences papers and considering only journal articles in the English language. These limitations reduced the total number of papers to 97. Afterward, final shortlisting of papers was carried out by the relevance of individual papers, given the context of this research, which provided the final 40 papers to be analyzed. Given the limited

number of publications in this area, the authors have also considered those manuscripts which were accepted and made available online in 2015 but due for publication in 2016. The step-by-step exclusion criteria and the resulting number of papers are given in Table II.
(3) Data analysis: an inductive approach has been used for data analysis. The analysis is performed in the following sections as initial data statistics, bibliometric analysis and text visualization. BibExcel is used for the purpose of bibliometric analysis. The analysis includes author, affiliation and keyword statistics. Moreover, gpsvisualizer.com is used for mapping affiliations on their frequency. In addition, VOSviewer is used for the network analysis of title and abstract text of shortlisted papers.

Initial data statistics The Scopus database classifies the shortlisted papers into a number of subject areas. The top ten subject fields are given in Table III. Some of the papers are mentioned in more than one field, as classified by Scopus. Furthermore, the publishing trend is shown in Figure 1, which shows the number of papers plotted against years. The first paper appeared in 1994 by Fischer (1994). He pointed out the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) principles and techniques in a geographic information system environment for applications including land-use planning, distribution logistics, etc. Afterward, the field is revived in 2001 following a long gap of seven years. Since 2001, there is an overall increasing trend of publications with some peaks and troughs. The publications have relatively increased in the past three years; however, the absolute frequency is still low. It is also observed that the 40 papers were published in 32 different journals. The top five journals that have published more than one paper and shared a total of 12 papers representing 30 percent of all articles are shown in Table IV.

The selected papers are classified into three categories, based on their focus on certain dimensions of sustainability, namely economic and environmental (ENV ), economic and social (SOC), and economic, environmental and social (SUS). Table V shows the differentiation of these papers and their organization in descending order of authors based on publication year. It is revealed that 27 papers addressed both ENV aspects; however, interestingly only one paper focused on SOC dimensions. The trend of incorporating all the three dimensions of sustainability started relatively late with a total of only 12 intermittent publications since 2007.
Bibliometric analysis This section mainly presents the analysis of authors, keywords and affiliations. Identifying the key researchers and universities across the globe will help scholars, students and organizations to conduct research with relevant researchers at various universities (Fahimnia et al., 2015). In this regard, BibExcel is used for this purpose which extracts and analyzes bibliographic data. The data of shortlisted papers that includes author name, affiliation, journal, paper title, abstract, publication year are exported from Scopus in RIS format which is compatible with BibExcel.

Author influence The data of all authors were extracted from those 40 papers and the frequency of authors was observed. It is revealed that out of 149 authors only two authors, Kengpol and Tuammee, have had their papers published more than once. These authors are also found to be the only key paired authors. They belong to King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok having their papers published in International Journal of Logistics Management and International Journal of Production Research in 2014 and 2016, respectively. This finding can be taken as the very beginning stage of collaboration among scholars. However, there is a need for more collaboration of scholars from different regions, universities and subject areas to enrich this field of study.
Affiliation statistics Likewise, based on authors’ data, the affiliation data are extracted with respect to each author from RIS file using BibExcel. The city names are obtained from each affiliation where the organization is located. Using city information and its frequency, the geographical distribution of affiliations is mapped with gpsvisualizer.com; a free online utility that creates customizable maps and profiles from GPS data and addresses, and is presented in Figure 2.
The size of red spot reflects the contribution of each organization (city) associated with those 40 papers. It is apparent that greater density is found in three regions across the globe, which are the eastern part of USA, the Western Europe and the Far East. Table VI presents top contributing countries along with their respective number of papers. It is apparent that the USA is the most active country in this research area, followed by European (UK and Italy), and finally the Far Eastern region. Conversely, there are only four top affiliations which contributed to more than one paper as shown in Table VII. It is pertinent to note that despite the USA being the most active country in this particular field, Purdue University is interestingly the only one among the top four affiliations.
Furthermore, Table VIII shows international collaboration in the 40 papers of our study. It reveals that the top four collaborations are either with USA or UK. This could be attributed to the possibility that the authors from Far East or Europe may be pursuing their

terminal research degrees from US or UK universities. However, at this moment, this would require further investigation to validate this assumption.
Keyword statistics The keywords belonging to each paper were extracted from the RIS file using BibExcel. Table IX shows a list of 16 out of 70 keywords from 40 papers, which appeared at least twice.

Similarly, Table X presents the list of most popular words appearing in the paper title. Though the frequency of keywords is limited to cover a broader scope, it is inferred from the top most words found in both tables that the current research is about helping organizational managers to solve logistical issues with the objective of reducing environmental impact. Moreover, certain decision-making approaches were also traced such as AHP, DEA and simulation. To further validate this inference and to explore this further through the text used in these studies, text mining was carried out based on the texts appearing in the titles and abstract of shortlisted papers.
Text network visualization The texts from titles and abstracts of papers were exported in comma-separated value file format and used as input for text mining using VOSviewer software to explore the text pattern presented in Figure 3. The size of circles and text visibility are proportional to the occurrence of words. The text visualization also shows links between terms that are appearing together. A total of 1,462 terms were found by the software out of which 156 words were selected to be mapped that appeared at least three times, although the data have certain noise and are not enough to perform rich analysis and clustering. However, the text visualization highlights the inferences made from the keywords analysis. Most of the papers are primarily concerned with proposing a model, framework, approach or decision support tool to solve logistics issues with a focus on reducing cost and environmental impact including the carbon footprint.
However, it can be seen that social impact is given less attention in the existing body of research. Moreover, analytic hierarchy process as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach has been used for prioritizing criteria or factors for decision making. Simulation term was also witnessed in the visualization map that might have been used for both organizations and policy makers in green logistics. It is inferred that the main areas

Conclusions, limitations and future directions This paper presents a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of literature about DSSs for sustainable logistics. It is pertinent to note that the state of research in this area is still in its infancy and requires swift advancement given the dynamics of business environments. We have used bibliometric and visualization tools to analyze journal paper data and have drawn the following conclusions from this study: first, the publication trend in this area has been rising since 2013; however, the absolute frequency of these publications is still low. Second, there are only two top contributing authors in this area who are also found to be the only paired authors. Third, the only influential journal in this area is International Journal of Production Economics, which published four papers in the last two years. Fourth, the geographic distribution of contributing affiliations is focused at the eastern part of North America, Western Europe and Asia. Fifth, the top collaborating organizations are either within the USA or the UK. Sixth, the keyword statistics and text visualization reveal that certain models, systems and frameworks have been proposed to solve logistical issues concerning sustainability but the research area is partially covered regarding various DSS configurations as well as different types of problems within logistics.

Like any other research study, this paper also comes with certain limitations. Besides journal articles, conference papers could also have been included in the study and further analysis could also be performed including citation, co-citation, page rank analysis and data clustering. Moreover, content analysis may also be effective in order to identify the nature of models, issues, sustainability dimensions and technologies employed. This study is conducted on the basis of papers obtained from Scopus, which is considered to be a comprehensive database. However, there is a possibility of gathering more relevant journal articles by exploring other databases as well, such as Google Scholar, the Web of Science, etc. The methodology used in this paper reveals only the trend at a macro level including publication trend, key affiliations, authors and journals. It does not interpret the knowledge contained in these papers. A more comprehensive systematic bibliometric and content analysis can be carried out to validate the results of our findings and to develop thorough understanding by including literature from other databases, including conference papers.
The findings of this paper have both academic and practical implications. The current set of findings, affirming DSS in sustainable logistics is an emerging field, will initiate accelerated development of this area including freight transport through road, rail, sea, air as well as inter-modal transport, port operations, material handling and warehousing. The geographic distribution of researchers and affiliations working in this field will help other interested researchers to identify and collaborate with them. Given the diversified nature of DSS, researchers may seek the utility of different types of DSS including knowledge-based systems, model-based systems, communication-based systems and databased systems or a hybrid of these. The research area has also the potential of validating the usage of AI approaches and/or various MCDA models or a combination of them to complement the result. Moreover, there is room for researchers to realize the need of simultaneously covering SUS aspects of sustainability in order to take into account the concerns of all stakeholders while developing a DSS. Consequently, the resulting DSS will help logistics managers in making effective decisions to make the operations profitable as well as to have a broad and long-term positive impact on the environment and society.
The implications from findings together with the limitations of this study further open new research avenues for future studies. This review is part of an ongoing project exploring this emerging field and will consider above limitations in future work.

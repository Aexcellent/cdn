Abstract 
 
Minimizing the breach detection gap (BDG) for cyber-attacks is a big concern for all organizations and governments. Cyber-attacks are discovered daily, many of which have gone undetected for days to years before the victim organizations detect and deploy the cyber defense. Cyber defense solutions are advancing to combat risks and attacks from traditional to next-generation advanced defense protection solutions. However, many individuals, organizations and businesses continue to be hit by new waves of global cyber-attacks. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled federated cloud computing framework that uses the Dempster–Shafer theory to reduce BDG by continuously monitoring and analyzing the network traffics against cyber-attacks. We evaluate the proposed approach using numerical results, and the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches.

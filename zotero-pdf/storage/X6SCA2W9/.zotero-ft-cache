Abstract: Accurate travel time prediction is of high value for freight transports, as it allows supply chain participants to increase their logistics quality and eﬃciency. It requires both suﬃcient input data, which can be generated, e.g., by mobile sensors, and adequate prediction methods. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are well suited to solve non-linear and complex relationships in the collected tracking data. Despite that, only a minority of recent publications use ML for travel time prediction in multimodal transports. We apply the ML algorithms extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) to this problem because of their ability to deal with low data volumes and their low processing times. Using diﬀerent combinations of features derived from the data, we have built several models for travel time prediction. Tracking data from a real-world multimodal container transport relation from Germany to the USA are used for evaluation of the established models. We show that SVR provides the best prediction accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 17 h for a transport time of up to 30 days. We also show that our model performs better than average-based approaches.

1. Introduction
An accurate travel time prediction is of high value for freight transports, as it allows supply chain participants to increase their logistics quality [1–3]. A material planner at the receiving plant can identify delayed deliveries in advance, and forecasts of material stocks can be optimized through this. Furthermore, a plant can adjust its capacities in time, e.g., staﬀ or machinery, and increase its eﬃciency. Logistic service providers beneﬁt in the same way. At warehouses, ports, or other hubs, capacities concerning staﬀ, ramps, forklifts, etc. can be scheduled accordingly. Consequently, manufacturers and logistic service providers can enhance their eﬃciency, optimize their processes, and increase planning accuracy [1,3,4].
Generally speaking, a supply chain involves all collaborative operations by all involved companies to transform raw materials into the ﬁnal product. This includes activities such as sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, assembly, and distribution to the end customer. To do so, logistics for the handling, transport, and storage of materials is required. While logistics deals with the operational level, supply chain management deals with the planning and management of supply chains. Logistics also

includes the task to provide information between the various stages in the supply chain. Usually, a number of companies or organizations are responsible for the transport. Especially in multimodal transports with various transshipment points, these conditions make the supply chain signiﬁcantly more complex. [5] This work focuses on estimating travel time accurately in multimodal transports. Accurate travel time estimates are important for eﬃcient management of transport operations and logistics in supply chains.
For travel time estimation, a continuous monitoring of freight transports is required, e.g., by using mobile sensors attached to transported goods [6]. At the same time, achieving the required transparency is one of the most challenging tasks in logistics [7]. Travel time prediction is also diﬃcult, as many factors, such as weather, traﬃc, vehicle, route, or transport relation inﬂuence it [8].
Currently, the majority of the published literature deals with passenger transportation, such as bus arrival times or highway travel times, rather than freight transports. Hereby, only rides with a duration of up to two hours are considered, which is not applicable to freight transports [9,10]. For travel time estimation, the authors use average-based approaches [11,12], Kalman ﬁlters [13–17], or machine learning (ML) algorithms (see Section 2). Furthermore, in their research, the route and stops are known in advance.
As per [9], only ML algorithms can adequately deal with complex and dynamic behavior during transports. ML has the ability to deal better with complex and non-linear relationships between predictors and can process complex and noisy data [10]. The literature also conﬁrms this statement, as ML approaches usually perform better than average-based approaches [18–20]. Despite this situation, ML has only been applied in a minority of recent publications dealing with travel time prediction in freight transports [1,2,21,22].
In the forecasting of multimodal freight transports based on real-time tracking data, only very limited research has been conducted, which mainly uses average-based approaches [23]. Consequently, this paper focuses on the evaluation of ML for long term forecasting to predict travel times of multimodal freight transports. Tracking data is generated by sensors, which are attached to the transported goods. The sensor data is transmitted with a low frequency in longer periods of 30 min, due to a small battery coverage. Except for the origin and destination, no further information concerning the exact route and trans-loading points are available beforehand. Finally, we can show that machine learning algorithms can adequately predict travel time under the given constraints. In our use-case, support vector regression (SVR) provides the best prediction accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 17 h for a transport time of up to 30 days. We also show that our model performs better than average-based approaches.
We organize the rest of the paper as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of literature dealing with travel time estimation using machine learning to identify the research gap. Section 3 describes the selected learning algorithms and the framework of this work. Section 4 presents the use-cases and the collected tracking data, which will be processed and transformed in Section 5. Section 6 describes the process of creating the prediction model. The results are evaluated and compared to average-based models in Section 7. In Section 8, we conclude the paper and suggest further work in this ﬁeld.
2. Literature Review
In this paper, we evaluate the capability of machine learning algorithms to predict the travel time in multimodal transports. Most research in this realm has been conducted on travel time prediction for segments of streets or highways and bus rides. Only a minor part of the research is related to freight transports or similar applications.
The authors of [24] use data from loop detectors and a global positioning system (GPS) to determine speed, occupancy, and volume of cars on highways, and include previous transport times to predict travel times on a four-mile stretch of highway. They use artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) as a learning algorithm. Similarly, the authors of [25] only include loop detectors and use support

vector machines to estimate travel time on highway segments of up to 350 km. Ref. [26] identiﬁes random forests (RF) as the best approach for predicting travel times on urban street segments using GPS data from 300 probe vehicles. In a similar use-case to ref. [24], the authors of [27] evaluate a gradient boosting method and RF for travel time estimation on highway segments and show that the gradient boosting method performs best. The authors of [8] also show that gradient boosting provides a good prediction. The authors also evaluate diﬀerent features based on GPS data. They establish that including the speed between two transmissions increases prediction accuracy by 5%. The authors of [28] evaluate deep neuronal networks using 12 months of GPS data and the previous 12 travel times as features. Even for a 131 km stretch, their approach results in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.25 min. The above approaches do not consider any end-to-end transport relations as with freight transports. In addition, exact advance knowledge of the route and a high frequency of GPS measurements are required, or side-based approaches such as loop detectors are used.
Considering bus travel time prediction, nearly all authors, such as [18,29–33], use ANNs in their research. In all cases, the route is known in advance and is separated based on the bus stops. Most of the approaches only diﬀer when considering the evaluated use-case and the used features. Usually, features such as the time of departure, public holidays, dwelling time at bus stops, current travel time, distance to destination, and average speed are used. Similarly, the authors of [20] also apply ANNs to tramways. The authors of [31] identify ANNs as a better approach than k-nearest neighbors (kNN), while the authors of [34] show that support vector regression (SVR) performs better. The authors of [35] use a multilinear regression for prediction. To consider all previous stops in their model, the authors add the cumulated number of stops and dwelling time. In contrast to the previous approaches, the bus ride is related to an origin and destination considering an end-to-end transport relation including stops, similar to freight logistics. However, the authors have not considered that many stops within supply chains are often unknown to supply chain participants and can diﬀer between transports using the same transport relation. Furthermore, their approaches require a high number of rides and assume a high frequency of GPS measurements.
The authors of [2] apply SVR on milk run freight transports. They comment that SVR can better generalize information than neuronal networks. Hereby, the stops of the milk run are known in advance. Their prediction model achieves an accuracy of three minutes. However, it requires 1800 rides for training. The authors of [36] consider random forests (RF) as a reasonable algorithm to predict aircraft arrival times. Flight related data such as delays, origin, destination, position, weather data, and data from the air traﬃc control have been taken to consideration. The authors can prove that their estimation is better than the one provided by air traﬃc control. The authors of [1] apply neuronal networks and SVR to predict the time of arrival of container transports. The timestamp, distance to destination, and geo-coordinates have been chosen as features, as well as weather information. The authors show that SVR performs better than ANNs and that weather data does not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the transport time. Finally, the authors of [21] evaluate kNN, SVR, and RF for arrival time prediction of open-pit trucks. Hereby, a site-based approach is used. The position is only measured at a few discrete nodes of the route network, and no GPS data is used. RF provides the best prediction results.
The literature review shows that none of the identiﬁed research has yet been conducted on multimodal transports with the transported goods themselves being equipped with a sensor instead of the transport vehicle. Furthermore, the research has also not yet considered the scenario where transported goods are equipped with sensors with a small battery coverage that are consequently transmitting position data with a low frequency, in this case every 30 min, in comparable distances. The concluding algorithm has to be capable of deriving a good prediction with a lower amount of data. In addition, the case of the route being unknown has not been considered in the research.

3. Methodology
The following chapter provides a description of applied machine learning algorithms and the corresponding parameters of models based on the knowledge from the literature review. A framework of the proposed approach is also presented.
3.1. Choice of Learning Algorithms
This research will select extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and support vector regression (SVR) as representative algorithms for modelling, according to the results of the literature review. All three algorithms are capable of adapting to complex systems and are robust in dealing with complex and small data sets. They have shown superior performance in previous research with low processing time [1,2,25,37].
Support vector machine (SVM) is a classiﬁcation technique based on the concept of supervised learning. It aims to ﬁnd the decision boundary between data points and separate them by an optimally derived hyperplane maximizing margin [25] (pp. 277–278). SVM is applied to regression problems as SVR. Brieﬂy speaking, SVR deﬁnes a weight for each variable of the model and learns the behavior of the data through a training and testing process. The kernel trick is applied to ﬁnd a nonlinear decision boundary by creating a much higher dimension of new features transformed from existing features [38] (pp. 282–284). A common and well performing kernel function for travel time prediction is the radial basis function (RBF) [39] (p. 216). The other two hyper-parameters, ε and C, are important for structuring a decision boundary. While the parameter, ε, describes an insensitive loss function that penalizes prediction residuals larger than the value speciﬁed by it, C describes the tolerance towards prediction errors as a regularization parameter [40] (pp. 68–73).
SVR models have shown plausible performance in recent research due to their good ability to generalize data and guarantee global minima compared to other methods. The processing time can also be low, given the constraints of a small data size and high problem complexity [25,39]. For these reasons, SVR is chosen as one of the algorithms in our study.
Extremely randomized trees (ExtraTrees) is a tree-based ensemble method for both classiﬁcation and regression problems. The basic principle behind ExtraTrees is to randomly create a number of diﬀerent trees (n_estimators) with randomly chosen features. This process minimizes the variance of the prediction results [41] (pp. 3–4). In this study, regularization parameter, random_state, is also considered, which initiates the random number generator to randomize characteristics in trees [42] (p. 619).
Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) is one of the most widely used boosting approaches, based on the concept of combining weak and inaccurate learners, mostly decision trees, to a strong and accurate learner. In regression problems, AdaBoost acts as a meta-estimator, which uses a weighted sum of prediction errors for a number of regressors to increase performance. These weights on the dataset are subsequently updated based on the prediction errors of the previous regressor. Important hyper-parameters of this method are the number of estimators (n_estimators) after which the algorithm will stop and the learning_rate that determines the degree of the weight adjustment [43].
According to [21,44], both ExtraTrees and AdaBoost are used for travel time prediction and have shown reasonable results with low errors. With the support of previous practical success, we also chose these two methods to build our prediction model.
3.2. Framework
In this research, the framework has been derived from the theory of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) data mining process ﬂow [45] (pp. 72–73) and is shown in Figure 1.

Similar to [46] (p. 39), before applying the clustering algorithm on all tracking data, potential stop

points are determined to decrease noise in the identiﬁed clusters. In a previously performed experiment,

a gateway had been attached to a container, which was standing at the same position for two days.

Hereby, noise of up to 300 m has been identiﬁed in the GPS data. Similarly, only tracking points with

a distance smaller than 300 m either to the previous or next transmission are chosen for clustering.

This rule applies to all points, P1 to P7. Further, to identify only signiﬁcant stops, at least four

consecutive points have to be identiﬁed, with a distance below 300 m between each other on a ride.

The day of the week is classiﬁed into weekday, Saturday or bridge day, and Sunday or public holiday, [33] (p. 2) and [37] (p. 151).
Similar to [36], the created features can also be associated to diﬀerent data sources for further evaluation. Table 2 shows the determined data sources.

Finally, Table 3 gives an overview of the developed features, with the assigned data source in the column data. Furthermore, the features have been marked as categorical (Cat) or continuous. As categorical features are not ordinally scalable, they have to be encoded into numerical features. This means that each characteristic of each categorical feature is transformed into a binary numerical value. As many features are created by this procedure, which increases the model complexity, we have not applied the encoding procedure on the PastRoutePath. Instead, we have created one binary feature per cluster, which determines if a cluster has already been visited, or not.

6. Modelling
The following section deals mainly with the choice of relevant features in Section 6.1 and the hyper-parameters of the model in Section 6.2. Therefore, the cleansed and pre-processed data have already been divided into a training and a test set (see Section 5.2). The test set is relevant for evaluation purposes, which is performed in Section 7. For the modelling phase, only the training set is used.
6.1. Feature Selection
Based on a rough descriptive analysis of the processed data with the generated features, we are aware that not all features exert a positive and strong impact on travel time prediction. This makes feature selection highly important for this study before s modelling begins. According to [48], in this study we only consider ﬁlter methods, as these methods are generally less time consuming. Furthermore, easily interpretable metrics are used, and the feature selection can be performed independently from the training process. Finally, the aim of this chapter is to determine diﬀerent experiments considering diﬀerent combinations of features to apply to the machine learning algorithms. Therefore, ﬁve ﬁlter methods have been applied in our study:
• An easily interpretable method is one that uses a variance threshold. Features with a variation below a certain cut-oﬀ value have been removed. Therefore, for each feature, we identify the value with the highest frequency and divide it by the number of data points to calculate the percentage. In our study, features with at least 90% of their instances remaining constant are removed, and the threshold is set to 0.9 [49] (p. 509).
• F-regression runs an F test for each feature (regressor), relevant for travel time prediction apart from the target. Therefore, the variance of each feature and the target is calculated. The ratio provides the F value, which is then transformed into a p-value using the F probability distribution. Consequently, the p-value scores the individual eﬀect of each regressor [50] (p. 629).
• The mutual information method considers non-linear dependencies as well as linear relationships by calculating the distance between the probability distributions of two features [51] (pp. 175–178). A feature selection procedure has been conducted by ranking the calculated mutual information of each feature.
• As per [48], the feature selection based on the ReliefF algorithm provided a superior performance in previous research. The applied algorithm considers feature interaction and is implemented in a way so that both continuous and categorical features can be processed. The algorithm calculates weights for each features, which are used for ranking them. Therefore, for a number of iterations, a random instance of all feature, which represents a row in the data, is chosen. For this chosen instance, the instances with the nearest hit and miss are identiﬁed based on the Manhattan distance. Finally, a diﬀ-function is used to calculate the weight for each feature by subtracting it from the weight of the previous iteration. In the ﬁrst iteration, the weight is set to zero. A higher weight means a better feature based on the ReliefF algorithm [48] (p. 487).
• Correlation based feature selection (CFS) is another well-known ﬁlter method, which calculates the correlation between predictor and target and then ﬁlters out features with a correlation below a given threshold [52] (pp. 361–362).
Figure 8 presents the overall structure of experiments created based on the selected ﬁlter methods. For F-regression, mutual information and ReliefF, features are ranked with certain scoring metrics and are subsequently selected for modelling as top 10, 15, and 20. For CFS, features have been ﬁltered with three predeﬁned thresholds for a moderate (0.5), high (0.7), and very high (0.9) correlation based on [53]. The use of all features has also been considered as an experiment. The application of those ﬁlter methods using diﬀerent thresholds, as well as the use of all features for modelling, leads to 14 experiments.

Further, basic features considering the distances to origin and destination as well as driven time to origin, which are often used in the literature, are identiﬁed as relevant. In addition, the self-developed counter of the average speed has been considered several times. Features considering the country or day class have been identiﬁed as less important for travel time prediction. However, some of them are still treated as important features for some feature selection methods.

7. Evaluation
This chapter presents the evaluation results from all experiments by conducting meaningful comparisons and analysis through the results. Therefore, the test set is used to consider data that have not been seen by the model before. Section 7.1 evaluates the results based on the machine learning algorithms, while Section 7.2 compares the best machine learning model to average-based approaches.

7.1. Evaluation of Machine Learning Models
In this section, prediction results obtained from the testing phase based on data considering diﬀerent feature combinations and various machine-learning algorithms have been compared and evaluated. Models created by SVR, ExtraTrees, and AdaBoost have been evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), two of the most common evaluation metrics [1], to estimate the performance of each model.
The MAE calculates how close the predictions are to the actual outcome in terms of the Manhattan distance. It is simply the average of all prediction diﬀerences and is located on the same scale that the data is measured on [1] (p. 9). Equation (1) deﬁnes how the MAE is calculated. Parameter n is the number of observed data points in the test set.

MAE

=

1 n

n
i=1 actuali − predictioni .

Since the MAE is based on the mean error, there is a certain chance that it understates the impact

of large, but infrequent, errors. To adjust such large and rare errors, we also calculate the RMSE.

The RMSE squares the diﬀerences before the mean is calculated and then takes the square root of the

mean, as shown in Equation (2). Through this, a measure of the size of the error that gives more weight

to the large but infrequent errors is achieved. The RMSE also provides information about the variance

of errors of a model. The larger the diﬀerence between RMSE and MAE, the more inconsistent the

error size.

Based on the previously described metrics, Table 5 shows the results of the best conducted experiment per learning algorithm. The overall best result has been obtained by SVR using the ReliefF method for ﬁltering, with a MAE of 16.91 h and RMSE of 22.7 h. The result is surprisingly good if we consider the small training set of ﬁve transports and a transport time of up to 30 days. The result of AdaBoost is still quite close to the SVR, while ExtraTrees has a signiﬁcantly bad prediction accuracy, with 43.66 h.

The same results can also be observed in Figure 11, where the MAE is shown in relation to the actual driven distance. One can see that the MAE of ExtraTrees is much larger than the other two. At the same time, AdaBoost and SVR provide a low prediction error. While AdaBoost provides a better prediction at the beginning, the prediction error of SVR decreases.

all completed transports, davg. The percentage of the remaining distance to the destination, 1 − dp,t+1,i, is used in Equation (6) to predict the remaining travel time by multiplying it with the moving average, ATTavg from Equation (3). Finally, the estimated travel time is again summed up with the time of departure to calculate the estimated time of arrival, ETAt+1,i.

dp,t+1,i

=

dt+1,i davg

ETTt+1,i = 1 − dp,t+1,i ∗ ATTavg

(6)

ETAt+1,i= ATDt+1 + ETTt+1,i

In [23], the prediction is based on the current transmission and position of a transport. To estimate the travel time, all transmissions of previous transports within a sensitivity radius are identiﬁed, together with their actual travel times to the destination. The average of all travel times of the identiﬁed transmissions is then used to estimate travel time for the current transport based on its current position.
In [11], the prediction of travel time is based on a predicted speed, vpred,i, of the current transport at the current transmission, i, derived from the distances to the origin, dO,i and destination, dD,i. The formula is shown in Equation (8). Hereby, vavg stands for the average speed from previous rides at the transport relation, and vP,i−1 stands for the speed to the previous transmission. In Equation (9), the predicted speed, vpred, is then used to calculate the estimated travel time by multiplying it with the distance to the destination, dD,i.

vpred,i

=

vavg ∗ dO,i + vP,i−1 ∗ dD,i dO,i + dD,i

(8)

ETTt+1,i = vpred,i ∗ dD,i

Table 7 compares the results of the presented average-based approaches to the SVR as the best-derived model from the previous section. The results show that travel time prediction based on machine learning algorithms is considerably more accurate. In particular, the SVR algorithm has a prediction error that is signiﬁcantly lower than the average-based approaches. Still, the average based approach is quite close to the prediction of the SVR, especially if considering the RMSE.

Table 7. Prediction results of the average-based approaches compared to the SVR.

RMSE

Figure 12 presents the MAE based on the distance to destination and proves that the SVR model performs best. Instead, [11,12] have a signiﬁcantly high MAE. The moving average comes closest to the results of the SVR model and can be identiﬁed by the constant line, as predictions are not actualized during the ride. The approach of [23] also proves a good prediction accuracy. Just at the end of the ride, the error increases signiﬁcantly. Here, a good prediction error is of high importance. While evaluating those results, one should also consider that the high errors of the average-based approaches occur because of the use of a sporadic transmission in a 30-min interval, a low amount of data, and the absence of information about the trans-loading points.

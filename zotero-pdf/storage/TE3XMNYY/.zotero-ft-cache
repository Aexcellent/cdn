Abstract: 
The Virtual Data Collaboratory is a federated data cyberinfrastructure designed to drive data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and collaborative research that will impact researchers, educators, and entrepreneurs across a broad range of disciplines and domains as well as institutional and geographic boundaries.

Scientific progress across disciplines is increasingly enabled by our ability to examine natural phenomena through the computational and/or data-centric lens (e.g., using algorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes) and our ability to acquire, share, integrate, steward, and analyze disparate types of data. Multimillion-dollar projects and instruments such as the large synoptic survey telescope (LSST) in Chile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, the Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) in the United States are all producing, or will produce, Peta Bytes of open-use data every year. Storing, filtering, analyzing, and more generally transforming these large datasets into knowledge require large high-end cyberinfrastructures capable of keeping up with the pace of streaming data. At the same time, individual researchers and smaller research groups are also generating raw data and data products, which also need to be managed, analyzed, and shared.

1. Introduction
Marketing is a restless, changing, and dynamic business activity. The role of marketing itself has changed dramatically due to various crises - material and energy shortages, inflation, economic recessions, high unemployment, dying industries, dying companies, terrorism and war, and effects due to rapid technological changes in certain industries. Such changes, including the internet, have forced today’s marketing executive to becoming more market driven in their strategic decision making, requiring a formalized means of acquiring accurate and timely information about customers, products and the marketplace and the overall environment. Internet marketing involves the usage of the Internet to market and sell goods or services. Internet marketing utilizes the power of electronic commerce to sell and market products. Electronic commerce refers to any market on the internet. The electronic commerce supports selling, buying, trading of products or services over the internet. Internet marketing forms a subset of electronic commerce. With the outburst of internet growth, internet marketing has started becoming very popular. It is said that Internet marketing first began in the beginning of 1990 with just text based websites which offered product information. With growth in internet, it is not just selling products alone, but in addition to this, information about products, advertising space, software programs, auctions, stock trading and matchmaking. A few companies have revolutionized the way; internet can be used for marketing, such as Google.com, Yahoo.com, Amazon.com, Alibaba.com and Youtube.com. This paper offers views on some current and future trends in internet marketing.
2. Review of Literature
A number of research papers and articles provide a detailed insight on Internet Marketing. The findings from the literature are presented below:Internet marketing has been described simply as ‘achieving marketing objectives through applying digital technologies’ (Chaffey et al., 2009). Digital marketing is the use of technologies to help marketing activities in order to improve customer knowledge by matching their needs (Chaffey, 2013). In the developed world, companies have realized the importance of digital marketing. In order for businesses to be successful they will have to merge online with traditional methods for meeting the needs of customers more precisely (Parsons, Zeisser, Waitman 1996). Introduction of new technologies has creating new business opportunities for

marketers to manage their websites and achieve their business objectives (Kiani, 1998). Online advertising is a powerful marketing vehicle for building brands and increasing traffic for companies to achieve success (Song, 2001). Expectations in terms of producing results and measuring success for advertisement money spent, digital marketing is more cost-efficient for measuring ROI on advertisement (Pepelnjak, 2008).
Today, monotonous advertising and marketing techniques have given way to digital marketing. In addition, it is so powerful that it can help revive the economy and can create tremendous opportunities for governments to function in a more efficient manner (Munshi, 2012). Firms in Singapore have tested the success of digital marketing tools as being effective and useful for achieving results. (Teo, 2005). More importantly, growth in digital marketing has been due to the rapid advances in technologies and changing market dynamics (Mort, Sullivan, Drennan, Judy, 2002).
In order for digital marketing to deliver result for businesses, digital content such as accessibility, navigation and speed are defined as the key characteristics for marketing (Kanttila, 2004). Other tried and tested tool for achieving success through digital marketing is the use of word-of-mouth WOM on social media and for making the site popular (Trusov, 2009). In addition, WOM is linked with creating new members and increasing traffic on the website which in return increases the visibility in terms of marketing.
Social media with an extra ordinary example Facebook has opened the door for businesses to communicate with millions of people about products and services and has opened new marketing opportunities in the market. This is possible only if the managers are fully aware of using the communication strategies to engage the customers and enhancing their experience (Mangold, 2009). Marketing professional must truly understand online social marketing campaigns and programs and understand how to do it effectively with performance measurement indicators. As the market dynamics all over the world are changing in relation to the young audience accessibility to social media and usage. It is important that strategic integration approaches are adopted in organization’s marketing communication plan (Rohm & Hanna, 2011). With the above reviews we can assume that GST is a tax reform which will change the scenario of the country as a support for this review study.

Blogs as a tool for digital marketing have successfully created an impact for increasing sales revenue, especially for products where customers can read reviews and write comments about personal experiences. For businesses, online reviews have worked really well as part of their overall strategic marketing strategy (Zhang, 2013). Online services tools are more influencing than traditional methods of communication (Helm, Möller, Mauroner, Conrad, 2013). As part of study, it is proven that users experience increase in self-esteem and enjoyment when they adapt to social media which itself is a motivating sign for businesses and marketing professional (Arnott, 2013). Web experiences affect the mental process of consumers and enhance their buying decision online (Cetină, Cristiana, Rădulescu, 2012).
The Internet is the most powerful tool for businesses (Yannopoulos, 2011). Marketing managers who fail to utilize the importance of the Internet in their business marketing strategy will be at disadvantage because the Internet is changing the brand, pricing, distribution and promotion strategy.

3. Rationale for the Study
The most interesting result of the technology explosion and easy access to it by consumers is the disruption of the market and the marketing practice. The customer today is an empowered customer, and in control of the interactive online media, content and communication process. The power of the traditional marketing tools and communication is diminishing and the customer has little trust to the corporate message and brand. Technology is changing the context of and practice of marketing: marketers are increasingly forced to operate in a complex and changing world where they do not have any more the full control of the media and the message. Customer behavior is also changing: the customer is losing trust and becomes much more critical, smart, well informed and proactive than ever before. New knowledge, new skills and new approaches are required by today and future marketers not only for understanding the changing and technology enabled marketing environment but also for comprehending and communicating with the new customer. The Marketing becomes increasingly digital and continuous technological developments present marketers with new challenges and opportunities: Mobile marketing, Internet of Things, Analytics, Big Data, 3D printing, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence, Consumer Neuroscience / Neuro marketing are some of the most interesting and challenging domains where the future marketer are expected to must be able to function and deliver.

the ultra-rapid development of digital technology and social media, it is an enormous challenge to keep track of those developments and to use them advantageously. That is why author felt a need to focus on this in this study.
4. Problem Statement and Study Objectives
Seeing that the strength of internet & social media will not decrease the upcoming few years, this topic will be crucial to every organization (Giedd & Chief, August 2012). The power of smartphones in combination with social media is a constant expanding threat to many companies (Felt & Robb, 2016). The second big point of consideration is related to the continuing trend of children, adolescents, and teenagers using digital and social media more and more excessively (Giedd & Chief, August 2012).

These questions will help us predict the trends in internet marketing and make suitable suggestions to companies.
5. Methodology
The exploratory research is designed to allow an investigator to basically look around with respect to some phenomenon, with the aim to develop suggestive ideas (Reynolds, 1971). This study is exploratory in nature and includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis. As a purpose of this study (critical review), data have been collected on all India basis.

The methodology used was that of a critical literature review.
6. Analysis and Discussion of Study 6.1 Internet Marketing
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks. “Internet works thanks to combination of a range of technologies and it is the biggest source of information mankind has ever had for its disposal. Internet also laid the foundations of more information channels than people have created until the 20th century.” (Phillips, 2003). The term Marketing has many deﬁnitions. One of the most well-known deﬁnition says that “Marketing is the social process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating and exchanging products and value with others.” (Kotler, Keller, 2007). By connecting these two ﬁelds “We can apply marketing principles within the internet area. This can be done mainly by creating a web pages, internet advertising, and also marketing research on the internet, electronic commerce etc. However internet marketing demands a little bit diﬀerent approach in certain aspects than traditional marketing.” (Blažková, 2005). Simply speaking internet marketing, also referred to as online-marketing, web-marketing, e-marketing, or i-marketing, is the marketing of products or services over the Internet.

In fact, internet marketing includes the use of a company web site in conjunction with online promotional techniques, such as banner advertising, search engines, PPC advertising, e-mail and links or services from other web sites to acquire new customers. Many people can think that internet marketing is just a website with its content, but it is much more complex. Internet marketing is interconnection among the site portal, search engines, partner’s sites, blogs, other site linking, B2B partners, customers, outsource partners and much more. For any type of marketing is essential to have as large number of audiences possible, as long as Internet marketing is concerned, the number of potential customers goes along with the usage of internet itself, Refer Fig. 1.

6.3 Different Trends/Techniques of Internet Marketing Internet marketing plan will help define specific e-marketing objectives and develop strategies to ensure that resources are deployed to take advantage of the marketing opportunities provided by the Internet, and to counter its threats. E-marketing is focused on how a company and its brands use the web and other digital media such as e-mail and mobile media to interact with its audiences in order to meet its marketing goals. We plowed through all the variety of marketing arenas from content and social marketing to marketing technology, analytics and organizational transformation, to find and establish the ultimate summary for marketing trends 2017. The various marketing trends articles of different authors and experts were read, dissected, analyzed and summarized as below:-
6.3.1 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) In layman’s terms, Search Engine Optimization or SEO is essentially tweaking your website so that it comes up naturally or organically for search results in Google, Yahoo Bing or any other search engine. Google updates its algorithms regularly so that only the relevant results come up. From that perspective, many experts say that SEO is dead and the effort is futile. However, the truth is that Google tries to prevent algorithm manipulation and filters sites that don’t deserve to be on the top of SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). So there is no doubt you should invest in SEO work. Your website should address the technicalities related to content and query matching, spidering, indexing, and interpreting non-text content. Remember, it is the most cost-effective marketing strategy that will bring organic traffic to your business.
6.3.2 Search Engine Marketing (SEM) Search Engine Marketing or SEM is the comprehensive strategy to drive traffic to your business, primarily through paid efforts. Hence it is also called Paid Search Marketing. The universe of SEM is diverse and complicated. Based on your business structure, you may choose PPC (pay- per-click) or CPC (cost-per-click) model, or CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) model. There are different platforms for SEM. By far, Google Ad Words (on Google Network) and Bing Ads (on Yahoo Bing Network) are the most popular. SEM also includes Display Advertising, Search Retargeting & Site Remarketing, Mobile Marketing and Paid Social Advertising.

6.3.3 Content Creation Content can be presented in different formats, including blogs, white papers, e-books, case studies, how-to guides, question and answer articles, forums, news and updates, images, banners, info graphics, podcasts, webinars, videos, or content for micro blogging and social media sites. All recent changes to Google’s algorithm - be it Panda, Penguin or Hummingbird - point to the fact that content is the most important metric while filtering search results. You can be creative and create content on any topic and then skillfully link it indirectly to your business. You may like to read our article on how to include content and market your startup or business free of cost. Also, you need to customize your content for different platforms. For example, the content for mobile phones should be crisp and short. Remember, an effective strategy will engage your readers and leave them interested in more information from you. Good content is shared and is the best way for branding your business.
6.3.4 Social Media Marketing (SMM) Social Media Marketing or SMM is an offshoot of your SEM efforts. It involves driving traffic to your sites or business through social sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn, etc. As we mentioned above, good content is shared and liked. So create and customize content for different social media platforms. Remember to be prolific and original; you need to engage with users on a daily basis, at least four to five times a day. Your SMM efforts can be especially helpful for branding and driving sales. The tools and approaches for communicating with customers have changed greatly with the emergence of social media; therefore, businesses must learn how to use social media in a way that is consistent with their business plan (Mangold and Faulds 2099). In order to create a successful marketing campaign via social media, a consumer must be open to the technology.
6.3.5 Digital Display Advertising This again is a subset of your SEM efforts. You may use a variety of display advertising formats to target potential audience - be it text, image, banner, rich-media, interactive or video ads. You can customize your message based on interests, content topics, or the position of the customer in the buying cycle. However, note that Digital Display Advertising is relatively costly. You need experts to drive good ROI for your business.

6.3.6 Mobile Marketing Mobile marketing is a relatively new branch of marketing, referring to the two-way marketing communication between company and customers that takes place via mobile devices. The website, apps and content is being customized for mobile devices. The mobile users are growing day by day and it is the most effective way of marketing. Dushinski (2009) in his paper defines mobile marketing as a revolutionary tool for connecting companies with each of their clients via their mobile devices in the right time, on a right place and with appropriate direct message.

6.3.7 Interactive Marketing Make sure your advertising strategy engages the potential customer in a conversation. According to a survey by ExpoTV.com, 55 percent respondents preferred to have ongoing communications with the companies they buy from; and 89 percent felt more loyal to the companies if they were invited to provide feedback. Use tools like widgets and opt-in features to make your website interactive, solicit feedback and track user behaviour. Engage with the customers actively and customize offers based on their preferences and browsing activities.

6.3.8 Viral Marketing Viral is today’s electronic equivalent of old-fashioned word of mouth. Viral Marketing is a strategy where a unique content spreads exponentially online, because the content is appreciated, shared and liked immensely. This is a great way to brand and drive traffic to your website. The content can take any format; all you need is to be creative. Marketers have caught the bug and are increasingly weaving viral components into their marketing plans. Not only is the approach relatively inexpensive, but also it can sometimes be more believable than standard ads.” (Howard, 2005)

6.3.9 Email Marketing When you send a commercial message through email to a list of potential customers, the strategy is called Email Marketing. With effective email marketing software, you can maintain email lists that are segregated based on several factors, including customers‟ likes and dislikes, and spending habits. Remember to send personalized emails; this helps to develop trust. However, note that Email Marketing may also be considered as spamming and there are laws against it in some countries.

6.3.10 Affiliate Marketing Affiliate Marketing is a performance-based marketing program, where you pay publishers who bring you customers. The performance may be based on conversions - promotions, leads or simply sales. You may like to be part of the affiliate programs of different publishers. Essentially, the publishers will give you space in their pages to advertise your business and help you drive conversions; and you will pay them based on the compensation model. You may avail the help from an Affiliate Network, which will give you a large base of publishers, and other benefits like tracking and reporting technology. Affiliate Marketing is especially useful for startups, as it will bring in more traffic to their business through high-traffic sites. In essence, Affiliate Marketing is a win-win situation for both the merchants and publishers. Sites like Amazon, eBay, LinkShare and Flipkart run Affiliate Programs. In fact, most online businesses with appreciable traffic have their own affiliate programs.

6.3.11 Online Public Relations (Online PR) Public Relation is signiﬁcant part of modern marketing tools. Companies that do not consider PR can loose customers. The question is how many customers they can loose? The answer of this question is very diﬃcult, because PR is much more diﬃcult to measure than for example internet advertising, however correctly realized PR brings always some beneﬁts to the company. Online PR has advantage over the traditional PR in the possibility of great and fast two way communication on the internet. Companies running an online business can develop online public relations through publishing PR articles in online PR catalogues, press releases in online media, by sharing videos or music containing commercial message or advertisement, or by participating in various discussion forums concerning the related topic or pro-ducts.

6.3.12 Digital Media Planning and Buying When a media agency researches and makes a comprehensive strategy framework, we call it Digital Media Planning. Be it in driving sales or conversions, launching a new brand or promoting an established brand, or changing customer behavior, the media agency plans different platforms and formats to reach the desired audience. It studies reach and frequency of different web-based and mobile applications. The agency works with different partners and buys relevant space and ideas. This is called Media Buying. In essence, Media Buying and Planning entails all the strategies that we have discussed above.

6.3.13 Web Analytics Perhaps, the most important aspect of your Digital Marketing is Web Analytics. Essentially, Web Analytics helps you to collect, measure, understand, analyze, plan, report and predict the web activities for your business. Web Analytics should not be confused with Web Statistics. As opposed to simple reporting, Web Analytics gives you analyses and different angles to ponder vis-à-vis your business. Some of the important Web Analytics tools are Google Analytics, Spring Metrics, Woopra, Clicky, Mint and Chartbeat. It goes without saying that every advertiser should use Web Analytics to understand his business and improve the ROI and conversions.

6.5 Traditional Marketing v/s Internet Marketing If we compare the methods of online marketing with conventional traditional marketing practices, then there are ample areas and opportunities where online marketing is competent and have its advantages and is always preferred over it.
Unlike traditional marketing where we have to wait for stipulated time frame to find out the response from the customers, online marketing is real time. Since we can the response of the customers in real time, it is easier to track if a particular campaign is working for the product or not and based on the feedback marketer can made the appropriate changes in the promotional campaign, in traditional marketing this flexibility is not possible. In traditional marketing, it is difficult for small retailers to compete with the big competitors in the market owing to the cost involved and strategy making expertise whereas in case of

online marketing, through a crisp website you can reach your target audience with wider reach with better service assurance. Cost involvement is another point which creates a lot of difference between the conventional marketing techniques over online marketing; business house can create its respective digital marketing strategy with very little cost and replace conventional costly advertising methods such as print media, radio coverage, television and magazine.

perceive shopping services on social networking sites as useful and easy to use, the more likely they are willing to shop for items on social networks. The wide range of consumers utilizing social networks means that most target markets can be reached (Cha 2009). Shankar (et al. 2011) also revealed in his study that more shoppers are using social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn) and rely on them for marketing shopping decisions; promotion through these media has become important.
In this study, we acknowledged that businesses can really benefit from Digital marketing such as search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, e-commerce marketing, campaign marketing, and social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, e–books, optical disks and games and are becoming more and more common in our advancing technology. Vogus (2011) also determined that large companies are regarding social media sites as strategic tools and some businesses are even hiring employees to oversee their social media pages. Mangold and Faulds (2009) recommended that social media should be regarded as an integral part of an organization’s integrated marketing strategy and should not be taken lightly.
It is demonstrated that we all are connected through whatsapp and facebook and the increasing use of social media is creating new opportunities for digital marketers to attract the customers through digital platform. Awareness of consumer’s motives is important because it provides a deeper understanding of what influences users to create content about a brand or store. This is also supported by Chu (2011), who examined the link between Facebook brand related group participation, advertising responses, and the psychological factors of self-disclosure and attitudes among members and nonmembers of Facebook groups. The study determined that users who are members of groups on Facebook are more likely to disclose their personal data than nonmembers are. Chu (2011) also found that users who are Facebook group members maintain a more favorable attitude toward social media and advertising.
Digital marketing is cost effective and having a great commercial impact on the business. Indeed, small companies are now able to reach targeted markets at a minimized cost and are able to compete with bigger companies, on an equal footing (F. Palumbo and P. Herbig., 1998).

8. Limitations of the study
Based on this study, it can further be argued that knowing which social media sites a company’s target market utilizes is another key factor in guaranteeing that online marketing will be successful. The effectiveness of Internet marketing with respect to different business can be analyzed. The study can further be extended to compare the internet marketing techniques with specific to various businesses.

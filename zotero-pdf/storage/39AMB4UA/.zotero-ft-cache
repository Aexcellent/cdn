Abstract: 
An approach to requirements engineering based on a combination of early prototyping, scenario-based analysis and design rationale is described. Requirements are elicited by presenting users with a prototype-simulation of a prospective design, combined with rationale based techniques for structuring probe questions. Design of analysis sessions and a walkthrough method for requirements elicitation are reported in three layers for linking questions to artefact/scenario demonstrations, follow-up questioning for user-system dependencies and handling user-analyst discourse. An empirical study of the requirements analysis approach is reported. The study used a ship board emergency application. The technique combination approach proved very effective in eliciting requirements but differences in analyst style were an important variable. Recommendations are made for designing and managing requirements capture sessions using scenario-based approaches.

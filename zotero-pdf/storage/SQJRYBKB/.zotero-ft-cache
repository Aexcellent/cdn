Abstract 
 
Scenarios play an important role throughout the information system development process. Scenarios are partial descriptions of system and environment behavior arising in restricted situations . They are instrumental to the following activities: describing and clarifying the relevant properties of the application domain, uncovering system requirements, evaluating design alternatives, and validating designs. This paper will describe these roles in the context of an example and explain how computer-based tools can support the use of scenarios throughout the development process. The thesis of this paper is based on experience with three such computer-based tools.

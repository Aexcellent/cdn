Abstract: 
The rise of big data and AI boosts the development of future wireless networks. However, due to the high cost of data offloading and model training, it is challenging to implement network intelligence based on the existing centralized learning strategies, especially at the edge of networks. To provide a feasible solution, a paradigm of federated learning- enabled intelligent F-RANs is proposed, which can take full advantage of fog computing and AI. The fundamental theory with respect to the accuracy loss correction and the model compression is studied, which can provide some insights into the design of federated learning in F-RANs. To support the implementation of federated learning, some key techniques are introduced to fully integrate the communication, computation, and storage capability of F-RANs. Moreover, future trends of federated learning-enabled intelligent F-RANs, such as potential applications and open issues, are discussed.

Introduction 
 
To satisfy the diverse multi-dimensional requirements of quality of service (QoS), such as enhanced broadband, ultra-reliability and low latency, and massive connections, a paradigm of fog radio access networks (F-RANs) has been proposed as a promising evolution path for the future wireless network architecture [1]. By integrating fog computing into wireless networks, some service requests can be fulfilled locally, which provides great flexibility to satisfy the QoS requirements of various application scenarios. Due to this great potential, F-RAN has become a research hotspot and draws a lot of attention from both academia and industry.
